      <p>This is the first page I ever made. Welcome.</p>
      <p>It took me a lot of trial and error. Mostly error.</p>
      <p>A shitload of error.</p>
      <p>I didn’t sleep for days, because of a semicolon.</p>
      <p>But then, that moment when you finally run your script..</p>
      <p>.. and it works.</p>

    <p id = 'about1' class = 'texttable'>It is about a year ago that I found out about a online coding challenge. As a newcomer to coding, this challenge was the perfect way to figure out if this is something that suits me. The next five days I received coding assignments. For this I had to use Google as a resource to find answers and tutorials. Before I knew it, I was <button id = 'codingbutton' onclick = 'codeMemeFunction()' class = 'intextbutton'>coding</button> until way after bedtime. Now I understood where this nerdy image came from, but it is definitely not boring. I discovered that coding is not just for ‘some special breed of humans’, but I can learn this as well. Now, I have quit my job and decided to be a coder. </p>
    <p id = 'about2' class = 'texttable'>Besides coding, I love to eat and cook. I never say no to <button id = 'foodbutton' onclick='foodbuttonFunction()' class = 'intextbutton'>food</button>. It is probably in my genes, as I have several family-members suffering from the same habit. Other things I like to do are: going to techno events and traveling. Asia is my favourite continent so far. Looking forward to meet you all in February!</p>
